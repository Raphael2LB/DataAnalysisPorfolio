Voici une courte introduction au projet Bike Sales mené entièrement sur Excel. 

Afin de consulter le dashboard final je vous invite à vous rendre sur le fichier "Bike_Sales.xlsx" présent dans ce dossier. 

Le livrable final consiste en un dashboard d'une page tel que ci-dessous :

1/ Objectif : 

This dashboard is intended for decision-makers in the bicycle sales business. 

It was chosen to highlight three visuals:

-A column chart representing bike sales by income and gender. 
-A line chart representing sales according to the home/work distance of customers. 
-A line chart representing sales according to age group (Young <31 years old / Middle aged 31 - 54 years old / Old 55 years +) 

Segments have been arranged in such a way as to respond more precisely to the questions of decision-makers. 

3/ Some conclusions : 

-The higher the income of individuals, the more bicycles they buy. 

-The home-to-work distance traveled seems to vary depending on the region. We note for example that in the Pacific, there are as many buyers who travel 0 to 1 miles as buyers who travel 5 to 10 miles. While in Europe most buyers basically practice 0 to 1 miles. 
It may therefore be interesting to initiate targeted marketing actions based on these commute distances by region. 

-Middle aged people tend to buy more bikes than young and old people.
