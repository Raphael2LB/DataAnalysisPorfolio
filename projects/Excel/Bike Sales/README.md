Here is a short introduction to the Bike Sales project conducted entirely in Excel.

The final deliverable consists of a one-page dashboard as below:

In order to consult my work file, I invite you to go to the "Bike_Sales.xlsx" file present in this folder.

1/ DATA : 

The data used comes from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx
This is information pertaining to bike buyers from all over the world. 

2/ OBJECTIVES : 

This dashboard is intended for decision-makers in the bicycle sales business. 

It was chosen to highlight three visuals:

-A column chart representing bike sales by income and gender. 
-A line chart representing sales according to the home/work distance of customers. 
-A line chart representing sales according to age group (Young <31 years old / Middle aged 31 - 54 years old / Old 55 years +) 

Segments have been arranged in such a way as to respond more precisely to the questions of decision-makers. 

3/ SOME CONCLUSIONS : 

-The higher the income of individuals, the more bicycles they buy. 

-The home-to-work distance traveled seems to vary depending on the region. We note for example that in the Pacific, there are as many buyers who travel 0 to 1 miles as buyers who travel 5 to 10 miles. While in Europe most buyers basically practice 0 to 1 miles. 
It may therefore be interesting to initiate targeted marketing actions based on these commute distances by region. 

-Middle aged people tend to buy more bikes than young and old people.
